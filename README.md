# Group-7-Resturaunt-Online-Ordering
Project Idea: Online ordering application for resturaunt with a variety of food options

This project will involve system analysis, design, implementation, and testing of an Online ordering application for a resturaunt with a variety of food options. This system will be used by resturaunt staff and customers. Main objective of this software system is to make the resturaunt more accessible by offering online ordering and payment and a way for users to track their order. Ideally, this system should be accessible through the web as well as using a mobile app. However, for the CSE 360 class project, we will be developing a GUI based desktop application using javaFX. The following section explains the system operation and expected functionality

System Operation:

When a customer opens the GUI, they will have the option to log in or create an account and save their information for future use. There will also be a guest option, where customers can see the entire menu or search for a specific type of food, and add items to their cart. Customers will be able to see a list of everything they have in their cart, add more items, remove items, and see the total price of everything selected. Then they can enter their contact and payment information to purchase their choices. Once purchased they can see how many people are in line ahead of them and see the expected time their order will be completed in. Resturaunt staff will also be able to log in to add more menu items and give coupons to frequent customers.

Testing please delete me later :(
